mqmath.js
=======================

Do some math in javascript (node.js)

The cool stuff is in mqmath.js

planar_hamiltonian_cycle.js is an example of use

planar_hamiltonian_cycle.png is example output

(while planar_hamiltonian_cycle_SLOW.js is an overly complex and suboptimal solution to the problem, it is a much richer and more interesting example of mqmath.js usage)
