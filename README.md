mqmath.js
=======================

Do some math in javascript.

`planar_hamiltonian_cycle.js` is an example of use.

`planar_hamiltonian_cycle.png` is output from the example.

(While `planar_hamiltonian_cycle_SLOW.js` is an overly complicated and suboptimal solution, it is a much more interesting example of `mqmath.js` usage)
